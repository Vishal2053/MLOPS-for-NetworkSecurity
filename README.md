# MLOPS for Network Security - Phishing Detection

## 🔒 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting phishing attacks using machine learning techniques integrated with MLOps practices. The goal is to build a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for training, evaluating, and deploying models that can identify phishing websites and malicious activities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Automated loading and preprocessing of phishing datasets.
- **Model Training:** Implements classification models to detect phishing attempts.
- **MLflow Tracking:** Monitors experiments, tracks metrics, and logs models.
- **Pipeline Automation:** Seamless workflow integration from data ingestion to deployment.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Robust logging and error handling for better traceability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, MLflow, Keras, TensorFlow
- **MLOps Tools:** MLflow, Docker (optional), GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses phishing datasets comprising features extracted from URLs and website content to classify legitimate and phishing websites.

## 🔍 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishal2053/MLOPS-for-NetworkSecurity.git
   cd MLOPS-for-NetworkSecurity
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📈 MLflow Tracking
